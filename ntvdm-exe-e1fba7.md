ntvdm.exe, or NT Virtual DOS Machine, is a legitimate Windows component developed by Microsoft, primarily found in Windows 10, that allows users to run 16-bit applications in a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system environment. As a critical part of the Windows architecture, it facilitates compatibility for older software that was designed for earlier versions of Windows. Generally, ntvdm.exe is safe and does not pose a risk of being malware or a virus; however, users may encounter errors or issues related to it if they attempt to run incompatible applications or if there are system configuration problems. In some cases, malware can disguise itself using the name ntvdm.exe, so it's essential to ensure that the file is located in the correct system directory (C:\Windows\System32) and to run regular antivirus checks to maintain system integrity.
